# WebSockets API 

###### Please note that this is an open source project which is officially supported by EXASOL. For any question, you can contact our support team.

The JSON over WebSockets client-server protocol allows customers to 
implement their own drivers for all kinds of platforms using a
connection-based web protocol.

The main advantages are flexibility regarding the programming languages
you want to integrate EXASOL into, and a more native access compared to 
the standardized ways of communicating with a database, such as JDBC, 
ODBC or ADO.NET, which are mostly old and static standards and create 
additional complexity due to the necessary driver managers.

Content:
* In file WebsocketAPI.md you'll find the API specification of the protocol
* Several native EXASOL driver implementations using the JSON over WebSockets API protocol
